# General Assembly Homework 1 - Press Release

Homework assignment #1 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to recreate a press release about General Assembly's campuses worldwide. At this point we were beginner HTML and CSS only students and were NOT thinking responsively. I decided to add motion video, gradient background and social media icons and links for my page. I hosted my media on codepen pages prior to learning about git repositories.
